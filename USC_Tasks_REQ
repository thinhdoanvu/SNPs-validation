Some concept and task for COTS regeneration
Task1: 
Some basic concept you could google in our data:
1, FPKM/PPKM, expression unit , Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads
2, gene ontology, functional terms for biological processes. Three name space: biological process, molecular function, cellular component.
3, Crown-of-thorns starfish
4, regeneration
 
Task1: counting how many genes for each GO ID for those COTS neuron regeneration-related genes. Using the attached "Oki_Neuron_regeneration_gene_GO.txt" file.

From the results, I can see you have very good skill to handle data. Please learn more biological background about gene ontology enrichment analysis (hypergenomics test go, r package).
 
Task 1 command:
more Oki_Neuron_regeneration_gene_GO.txt |sed 's/"//g'|sed 's/#/\t/'|cut -f1,3|sed 's/,/\t/g'|awk -F"\t" '{for(i=2;i<NF;i++){print $1"\t"$i}}'|grep 'GO:'|sed 's/#/\t/' |cut -f1,2|sort -u|cut -f2|sort|uniq -c |sort -rn|more
 
Task 2: for each tissue, make a statistics for all the GO terms. (input file is "regeneration.oki.annotation")
The results will be:
Column1: tissue/NERON/TOOTH....
Column2:GO ID
Column3:Number of OKI geneID
Column4: the list of the OKI geneIDs.
 
Task 3: generate a GO background file for all the starfish genome using Oki gene ID (the file is attached).
oki_all_annotation.txt

The result will be like:
Column1:GO ID
Column2:Number of OKI geneID
Column3: the list of the OKI geneIDs.
 
Task 4: do the enrichment analysis for different tissues.
 
In summary, our goal is to identify the co-expression functional modules for regeneration in COTS.
